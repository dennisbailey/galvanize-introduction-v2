        <p>I'm looking forward to learning new skills and making some friends over the next few months. Maybe we'll even have a few laughs along the way.</p>

        <h2>Post-gSchool Hopes</h2>
        <p>After gSchool, I want to work on interesting problems with smart people. Maybe that'll be in Denver, maybe it will take me somewhere else. Who knows what will happen.</p>
        
        <p>Hopefully, I'll have more <em>skillz</em> than these two.</p>
